### Third-party services and permissions used
- Internet access, which allows for the usage of Firebase
- Firebase Firestore, which allows users to save their exercise progress, thought tracks, and meditation statistics
- Firebase Authentication, which allows for authentication, without which the Service's main functionalities will not work
- Firebase Realtime Database, which allows users to connect, which I view as very important in the context of helping those with stutter
- Firebase Storage, which enables users to have their profile pictures
- Firebase Crashlytics, which makes it possible for a developer to spot issues like crashes and app not responding
- Firebase Analytics, which helps a developer improve and adjust the product to specific audiences
- `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission in AndroidManifest allows users to cancel a meditation session from the quick settings menu. The Service will not feature this permission if:
  - The request is denied directly in the app when prompted.
  - A user revokes this permission in the app's settings if it has already been granted
